## Description
This document outlines a process adopted by some companies to enhance overall project workflow, ensuring all team members are aligned and potential issues are identified early.

it is done by going through the in-review and in-progress columns on the project board on the daily standup

## Detailed Guide
- **Leadership in Standups**: Standups should be led by the team lead, not the manager, to ensure focus on technical issues and relevant questions.
- **Review Order Adherence**: Follow a consistent order during board reviews, starting with items 'in review' followed by those 'in progress'.
- **Time Estimations and Next Steps**: Members should provide estimates for task completion and outline their next steps.
- **Prompt for Updates**: If a task has no recent updates, the responsible team member should be asked to provide a current status.
- **Open Forum for Blockers**: End each standup by opening the floor for questions and discussions about blockers, encouraging proactive problem-solving.

## Advantages
- **Accountability**: This process increases the accountability of the team members, as they will need to update the issues regularly
- **Communication**: Regular updates on each issue keep the entire team informed, especially regarding any delays or complexities that arise.
- **Transparency**: Maintains visibility of project progress and challenges being addressed.
- **Consistent Updates**: Frequent updating of issue statuses helps the team support each other and stay informed of each issueâ€™s progress.
- **Early Identification of Blockers**: Blockers are identified early, allowing the team to collaboratively find solutions.
- **Organized Workflow**: Helps in maintaining a clean board by moving issues to the correct columns and closing completed issues.

## Disadvantages
- **Increased Time Commitment**: Time spent discussing blockers and additional details may extend project timelines. It's recommended to schedule separate sessions for detailed discussions to mitigate this.
- **Additional Updates**: Team members need to regularly update issue statuses and labels, which requires additional time but is crucial for keeping the project organized.

## Conclusion
Adopting this workflow enhances communication and project transparency, significantly contributing to a more organized and proactive team environment. It is essential, however, to balance the time spent on updates and discussions to ensure it adds value to the project progress.
