## Rihal Developer Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Rihal development team! This guide will help you navigate through the process of contributing to our projects effectively.
### Onboarding 

- **Onboarding Documents**: Ensure you review the [Company Onboarding Document (Technical)]() which references all necessary existing documents.

## Workflow Guidelines

1. **Project Setup**: Follow the instructions in the [Readme]() to set up the project on your local machine.
2. **Issue Assignment**: Review the list of GitHub issues. If no issue is assigned to you, request an assignment from your Lead in the repository.
3. **Branch Updates**: Ensure the main branch is up to date by fetching remote changes and pulling from the main/develop branch.
4. **Branch Creation**: Use the [Rihal Branch Naming Standards]() to create a new branch from the main.
5. **Concise Changes**: Make your code changes in small, manageable chunksâ€”think of them as mini-achievements within the task.
6. **Committing Code**: Commit your changes at different checkpoints following the [Rihal Git Commit Guide]().
7. **Rebasing**: Before pushing changes, checkout to the main/develop branch, pull the latest changes, then checkout back to your feature branch, rebase, and resolve any conflicts.
8. **Push Changes**: Push your branch to the remote repository.

> Pull Request (PR) Process
9. **Creating a PR**: On the remote repository, create a PR for your task using the [Repository Pull Request Template]().
10. **PR Details**: Fill in the PR according to the requirements specified in the template.
11. **Labeling**: Add appropriate labels to your PR as guided by the [Rihal Labels Document]().
12. **PR Assignment**: Assign the PR to yourself, invite team members for a review, and link the PR to the appropriate project.
13. **Review Process**: Wait for team review. Do not merge a PR without approval to maintain code quality.
14. **Handling Reviews**: If changes are requested, discuss any unclear points with the reviewers, apply the necessary changes, and resolve the discussions.
15. **Finalizing PR**: Once all checks pass and the PR is approved, perform a `Squash Merge`.
16. **Clean Up**: After merging, delete the feature branch from the remote to keep the repository clean and organized.

Happy coding
